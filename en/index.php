                  We move on to the loan of a provider. The provider takes care of hosting your site. We act as a bridge between you and the hosting company. We have no costs to charge you. Our supplier takes care of all the technical aspects of the infrastructure, and we take care of the commercial aspects and after-sales service. To be honest, we only pay for the domain and site hosting. We don't have to pay any staff - we're passionate volunteers. Our provider earns money from domain sales and hosting improvements. We want to be transparent with you: we earn a commission, which is entirely reinvested in the project.

                  This project was born during the initial containment of the coronavirus pandemic. At the time, it was called FreeWebs. We were just two young teenagers whose ambition was to offer small retailers a solution for promoting their business and selling online. Unfortunately, we didn't see eye to eye and went our separate ways. Today, our new team has learned from past mistakes, and has rebuilt the project with greater ambition.
